# Review-2 completion status (handoff notes)

This documents exactly what was done in the most recent session working
through `PRD.md`'s checklist end-to-end, and what's left. Written so anyone
(or any agent) picking this up cold can continue without re-deriving
context.

## Done this session

1. **Real-world corpus evaluation actually run.** `corpora/freertos`,
   `corpora/arduino-core`, `corpora/zephyr` (gitignored, not committed) were
   cloned and benchmarked via `scripts/extract_identifiers.py` +
   `corpus_bench.exe`, producing `results/corpus_results.csv`. The paper's
   Real-World Workload Evaluation subsection (`budget_sym_v2.tex`, search
   `tab:corpus`) was rewritten with the real numbers, replacing unverified
   placeholder figures from an earlier draft. Honest finding: BudgetSym and
   plain Interned land within ~0.03x of each other on real code (~2.3x-2.5x
   vs conventional) because real identifier streams have very high repeat
   rates, which both implementations handle identically (`decide()`'s
   exact-repeat rule). BudgetSym's differentiation shows up on the
   synthetic prefix-similarity/nested-scope datasets, not these three
   general-purpose corpora. `docs/corpus_setup.md` was updated to drop the
   stale "no internet access" framing.

2. **Full 7-model ML comparison + feature ablation.** `scripts/train_threshold_predictor.py`
   now trains and compares Baseline Mean, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, Random
   Forest, SVR, and KNN (PRD Section 6.5 Step 2), writing
   `results/model_comparison.csv`, and runs a Ridge feature-ablation pass
   (Step 3) writing `results/feature_ablation.csv`. Ridge remains the model
   actually exported to `include/predicted_thresholds.hpp` (regenerated
   output is byte-identical to before this change, confirming stability).
   Paper Table III (model comparison) and Table VII (feature ablation) were
   added to the ML-Driven Threshold Prediction subsection.

3. **`results/benchmark_results_v3.csv` schema gap fixed.** PRD Section 7.3
   requires `insert_latency_us`, `memo_hits`, `memo_cold_lookups`, and
   `compression_ratio` columns that `src/benchmark_main.cpp`'s v3 pass
   didn't produce. Added (see `MetricsV3`/`runOneV3`/`writeCsvRowV3` in that
   file) and verified by rebuilding and rerunning `benchmark.exe`.

4. **`build.sh` wired to the training pipeline.** A new, soft-skipped step
   regenerates `include/predicted_thresholds.hpp` via
   `scripts/train_threshold_predictor.py` before compilation (uses `venv/`
   if present, falls back to system `sklearn`, otherwise skips and uses the
   committed header) -- `bash build.sh` invocation is unchanged.

5. Full rebuild + `tests/smoke_test.exe` verified passing after all changes.

## Not done — blocked on you

**PDF recompilation is the one remaining checklist item.** `budget_sym_v2.tex`
now has all the content the PRD requires (all 7 tables), but this machine
has no `pdflatex`, and installing it needs an interactive sudo password the
agent can't supply. This machine is **Arch Linux**, so the install command
is:

```
sudo pacman -S texlive-basic texlive-bin texlive-latexextra texlive-publishers texlive-latexrecommended texlive-fontsrecommended
```

Once installed, compile with:

```
pdflatex budget_sym_v2.tex
pdflatex budget_sym_v2.tex   # twice, for cross-references
```

Then verify all 7 tables (I through VII) are present, e.g.:

```
pdftotext budget_sym_v2.pdf - | grep -c "^TABLE"
```

...and replace the stale `BUDGET_SYM_v2_IEEE.pdf` (dated before all this
session's `.tex` edits) with the freshly compiled one.

## Known pre-existing gap (not introduced this session, worth fixing if picked up)

`build.sh`'s figure-generation step (`python scripts/plot_results.py ||
python3 scripts/plot_results.py`) fails with `ModuleNotFoundError:
No module named 'matplotlib'` because it calls the system `python3`, not
`venv/`'s interpreter (which does have matplotlib). Either activate `venv/`
in that step too (same pattern used for the new ML-training step above), or
document it as an expected, harmless failure in environments without a
system-wide matplotlib.

## Files changed this session

- `budget_sym_v2.tex` -- real corpus numbers + Table III + Table VII
- `docs/corpus_setup.md` -- dropped stale no-internet note
- `scripts/train_threshold_predictor.py` -- 7-model comparison + feature ablation
- `src/benchmark_main.cpp` -- v3 CSV schema completed
- `build.sh` -- optional training-pipeline step added
- `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md` -- synced with all Review-2 components
- New: `corpora/` (gitignored), `results/corpus_results.csv`,
  `results/model_comparison.csv`, `results/feature_ablation.csv`,
  regenerated `results/benchmark_results_v3.csv`
